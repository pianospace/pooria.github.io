        <h3>History of Rome </h3>
        <p>
            Rome, capital of Italy. It is situated on the Tiber River in the 
            central part of the country. The historical site of Rome on its 
            seven hills was occupied as early as the Bronze Age (c. 1500 
            BCE), and the city was politically unified by the early 6th 
            century BCE. It became the capital of the Roman Empire. The 
            Romans gradually conquered the Italian peninsula extended
            their dominion over the entire Mediterranean basin, and 
            expanded their empire into continental Europe. Under Pompey 
            the Great and Julius Caesar, Romes influence was extended 
            over Syria, Jerusalem, Cyprus, and Gaul. After the Battle of 
            Actium, all Roman lands were controlled by Octavian 
            (Augustus), the first Roman emperor. As the imperial capital, 
            Rome became the site of magnificent public buildings, including 
            palaces, temples, public baths, theatres, and stadiums. It 
            reached the peak of its grandeur and ancient population during 
            the late 1st and early 2nd centuries CE. It remained the capital 
            of the Roman Empire until Emperor Constantine the Great 
            dedicated Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 330. By the end of 
            7
            the 6th century, the protection of the city was in the hands of 
            the Roman Catholic Church. The papacy achieved absolute rule 
            in the 15th century. The city flourished during the Renaissance 
            and was the seat of the Papal States. In 1870 it became the 
            capital of a united Italy. It was transformed into a modern 
            capital in the 1920s and 30s and is Italys administrative, 
            cultural, and transportation Centre.
